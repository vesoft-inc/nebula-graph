Feature: Predicate

  Scenario: yield a predicate
    Given a graph with space named "nba"
    When executing query:
      """
      YIELD all(n IN range(1, 5) WHERE n > 2) AS r
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | r     |
      | False |
    When executing query:
      """
      YIELD any(n IN [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] WHERE n > 2) AS r
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | r    |
      | True |
    When executing query:
      """
      YIELD single(n IN range(1, 5) WHERE n == 3) AS r
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | r    |
      | True |
    When executing query:
      """
      YIELD none(n IN range(1, 3) WHERE n == 0) AS r

  Scenario: use a predicate in GO

    Then the result should be, in any order:

      | "Manu Ginobili"     | 95       |
      | "Tim Duncan"        | 95       |

  Scenario: use a predicate in MATCH
    Given a graph with space named "nba"
    When executing query:
      """
