Feature: Predicate

  Scenario: yield a predicate
    Given a graph with space named "nba"
    When executing query:
      """
      YIELD all(n IN range(1, 5) WHERE n > 2) AS r
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | r     |
      | False |
    When executing query:
      """
      YIELD any(n IN [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] WHERE n > 2) AS r

    When executing query:
      """
      YIELD single(n IN range(1, 5) WHERE n == 3) AS r

    Then the result should be, in any order:

      | True |
    When executing query:
      """
      YIELD none(n IN range(1, 3) WHERE n == 0) AS r

      | True |

  Scenario: use a predicate in GO
    Given a graph with space named "nba"
    When executing query:
      """
      GO FROM "Tony Parker" OVER like
      WHERE any(x IN [5,  10] WHERE like.likeness + $$.player.age + x > 100)

    Then the result should be, in any order:

      | "Manu Ginobili"     | 95       |
      | "Tim Duncan"        | 95       |

  Scenario: use a predicate in MATCH

  Scenario: collection is not a LIST
    Given a graph with space named "nba"
    When executing query:
      """
      YIELD single(n IN "Tom" WHERE n == 3) AS r
      """
    Then a SemanticError should be raised at runtime: `single(n IN Tom WHERE (n==3))': Invalid colletion type, expected type of LIST, but was: STRING
    When executing query:
      """

      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
